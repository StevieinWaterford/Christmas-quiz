### User Needs

As a user the site has to be accessible on mobile, tablet and all browsers. Information should be clear to read, informative and helpful. The site navigation needs to be optimal to move to the preferred section of the user.



## Scope

This service is one that is new to Waterford and the South East. I feel that it was necessary to set up this service in a smaller location outside the major urban areas of Dublin and Cork as to give locals a taste of continental beers in an area of the country that has been overlooked in ters of gastronomy and better drinking options.

## Structure

This is a four page website, The first page is the 
Geography and History questions page. The second page brings you to the Sport and Film questions. The top of the page shows how each category is priorotised.

## Deployment

This project is deployed using gitpod and github pages.  Github was used to write the code and seeing it is linked with github it was easy to use the terminal to commit, and push my code to their server. The deployed website is hosted on github pages.

1. Deployment was done in the following way:

2. Click on settings tab on my repository.

3. Click the pages tab.

4. Set source branch to master. This created a link to the deployed version of the website.
